# Plated app
The app is a recipe browsing application designed to help users discover and explore a wide variety of recipes from around the world.

### Steps to Run the App
Open in Xcode. This project can be run in the simulator for iPad and iOS.

### Focus Areas
Before writing any code, I spent time planning my approach. For functionality, I made a list of what was possible in 6 hours and what I would need to produce for the best possible outcome. I prioritized the core function, which is making a network call, then prioritized image caching, and finally, I spent a portion of my time researching other apps that are similar and that I can use as a reference to create something that would be in the app marketplace. 

### Time Spent
- I spent 8 hours on this project: two hours on research, design, and planning; three hours on image caching; and the remainder of the time was spent putting it all together. 

### Trade-offs and Decisions
- I chose to use the MVVM architecture design pattern because it allows me to modularize the logic from the view, which makes testing easier.  â€¨- I wanted to add a filter, but I did not have time to do so.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
- The weakest part may be the lack of advanced animations or interactivity within the recipe cards. While the design is clean, incorporating animations could further enhance user engagement and make the UI more dynamic.

### External Code and Dependencies: Did you use any external code, libraries, or dependencies?
 - I used no external code or third-party libraries for this component. All functionalities are implemented using native SwiftUI features to keep dependencies minimal for performance.
